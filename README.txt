Week 2 Short Response

Group member contribution:
Sarah -
Wrote code to initialize the player. Wrote helper functions for scoring, worked on implementing scoring heuristic. Helped on minimax algorithm. Debugged overall performance.

Laura -
Wrote code to implement minimax algorithm. Worked on integrating minimax with player moves. Helped debug overall performance. Worked on alpha-beta pruning.


What we did:
We improved the AI by tuning the score heuristic so that we emphasized aquisition of the corners and the edges. Moves that would give the opponent access to these positions were scored unfavorably. This way, we emphasized moves that make sense to a human player.
We also implemented minimax to look through possible moves and choose the least unfavorable move. This is to look ahead and predict the opponent's performance. 
We also worked on alpha-beta pruning in attempt to improve our minimax algorithm and prevent unnecessary searching of moves.
